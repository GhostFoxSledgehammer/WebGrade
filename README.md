#Website Ranking System

##Introduction
With the amount of information available on the web, finding what you need would be nearly impossible without some help sorting through it. Website ranking systems are designed to do just that: sort through multiple web pages available in our Search index to find the most relevant, useful results in a fraction of a second, and present them in a way that helps you find what youâ€™re looking for.

Our Project,WebGrade, is a basic Website Ranking System, which Ranks URLs on the basis of number of clicks by the user.For easier updation of DB(database), we have even developed a Web Crawler which scrapes an URL to a certain depth.
